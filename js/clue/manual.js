  {id:'core-cards',label:'Core thoughts',title:'Core Cards & Character Beliefs',html:"<p>Today’s Story is your character’s hand of Core Cards. Portrait cards show room-specific icons, companion markers and a short category label; hover or focus a card for its detail, or tap to reveal it on mobile. There are three slots by default; Notes → Core Cards allows a fourth. Direct questions in conversation still take priority. Unused slots remain inactive card backs until useful information supports a card. Brief sightings of yourself and routine lingering stay in Notes. Sustained room visits, remembered company and potential corroboration can become opening memories.</p><p>A Room visit records your own account. Company means you remember someone nearby; a potential Alibi identifies someone who may corroborate part of your account, not guaranteed innocence. You never gain knowledge of another character’s private memories from these cards.</p><p>Notes are weighted by source, visibility, trust, persuasion, skepticism, observation and memory. Belief percentages are character judgments, not guaranteed probabilities of guilt. Repeated gossip does not become independent proof. Conflicting direct observations reduce support.</p><p>Accusation cards name a person, room and weapon and require greater than 75% support. A verified, clear line-of-sight murder observation receives a Witness tag and 100%; merely sharing the room, hearing an account or seeing a body does not qualify.</p><p>Cards first become eligible after one minute of active day-one play, and only when useful evidence or sustained memories support them. They update periodically as new notes arrive after that and compile at day end in the background. Opening-day updates are staggered and pause for a guest while they are in conversation. Manual slot selections remain in place during those automatic opening-day updates until you explicitly recompile or a new daily compilation occurs. Recompile early in Notes (10-second cooldown), inspect supporting notes, and restore any still-valid archived card into a chosen slot. AI ranking can choose existing cards but cannot invent evidence or change confidence. It falls back to deterministic ranking if unavailable.</p><p>Finish your task early and efficiently to improve the automatic room-investigation roll. Measured quality and your observation/curiosity stats affect the check. Missing attempt telemetry uses neutral quality. A success can reveal a real point of interest; hidden contents still require opening or searching. Failure provides no invented discovery.</p><p><b>A staged scene can fool you.</b> A Location theory names a possible killing room, not a proven one. Discovery location, observed blood, dragging, cleaning items and soul traits affect belief. Only an actual, sufficiently covered search can supply a negative blood finding. Using the Lens makes that finding more informative but never conclusive; bleach and missed areas remain possible. Knowing about the Lens without using it grants no search result. A nearby weapon may have been planted. A body finder learns only what is actually visible near the body, not the engine’s hidden murder weapon. You can discuss a Core theory as an uncertain explanation.</p><p>Before a discovered body, witnessed attack or genuinely missing expected companion, conversations stay social. Opening recollections are not spoken as claims of innocence. Flicker observations receive priority and cards recompile when that phase ends: only actual visible company and weapons count, gaps remain unknown, and a later watch cannot clear an earlier killing.</p><p>Killers receive private cover-story and framing objectives. An NPC killer prioritizes a witness next time a kill is legal only if it actually knows who witnessed it. Verified firsthand murder witnesses gain +3 on persuasion rolls, not deception or physical pocket checks.</p><p>Voting strikes out self, dead and conclusively ruled-out choices. A diamond highlights your strongest supported choice; killers instead see a framing recommendation that protects their partner. Belief is not certainty, and a failed full combination does not disprove each individual component.</p><p>Darkness affects noticing clues, not whether a person physically exists on screen. People around hallway corners and open doorways remain rendered behind normal wall and door occlusion. Lights follow their switches and flicker state rather than your viewing direction.</p><p>Diagnostic reporting stores game-generated dialogue, offered choices, Core Card decisions, observed flicker coverage, rolls and match outcomes in an owner-readable database archive. Pending reports retry when connectivity returns. Reports are partial and client-reported; they do not authorize game actions. Microphone audio and account credentials are not collected.</p><p>Exact event times require your character’s own watch or an accurate clock they could see. Ivo carries a pocket watch. The dining clock is not reliable until set. Without a reading, characters recall events without an exact timestamp.</p>"},
  {id:'hair-permission',label:'Haircut permission',title:'Ask Before the Trim',html:"<p>Hold the Kitchen Knife and speak with a living human avatar who has usable hair. Share your haircut task in dialogue. Your request is spoken before the share-task roll. A human recipient chooses Allow or Refuse; an NPC can decline according to the roll, trust and personality. Success never removes the right to refuse.</p><p>The reply is spoken in the recipient's own voice. Only after an affirmative reply finishes do both characters walk to the bathroom barber chair. Refusing ends the exchange without moving anyone. At the chair, cut 15% of the starting groom to finish the task; either person may leave. Sneak cutting still uses a separate stealth contest. Robots have no hair, and a haircut task is waived when fewer than two living human avatars with usable hair remain.</p>"},
  {id:'pockets',label:'Pockets & D Rolls',title:'Asking to Check Pockets',html:"<p>Look directly at an available guest within talking distance for a moment to let your opening choices prepare. If you initiate, your character speaks the first greeting; an NPC who approaches you speaks first. Guests may excuse themselves according to their temperament and the conversation; after their farewell finishes, the exchange ends automatically. Direct accounts use you/your when referring to the person being addressed, while third-party accounts retain names. Greetings and direct address can naturally use a name, such as “Thanks, Tomas” or “Sera, can we talk?” without replacing it with “you.” Up to eight choices are ranked by the current question and your actual knowledge. Direct answers and witnessed murders get priority; hearsay stays attributed, and you can say you cannot confirm something or decline to answer. While anyone waits on dialogue AI, the shared round countdown runs at one-tenth speed; background preparation and spoken playback do not slow it. Private inner thoughts are labelled and do not animate mouths; actual spoken dialogue animates the speaker. Speech captions appear on the left, with responses at the bottom only when speech finishes. D Rolls appear at the lower right. Ask during conversation. The request finishes speaking before the recipient chooses <b>Allow</b>, <b>Refuse</b>, or another conversational reply. Each guest has their own way of saying yes or no.</p><p><b>Allow:</b> after the reply finishes speaking, the pockets are shown freely. There is <b>no D Roll</b>.</p><p><b>Refuse or change the subject:</b> after the reply finishes speaking, both guests roll a d20. The requester uses observation, stealth and persuasion; the responder uses observation, skepticism and boldness. Soul strengths and weaknesses add bonuses or penalties. A weighted score of 0.75 or higher grants advantage (roll twice, keep higher); 0.35 or lower gives disadvantage (keep lower). Compare the adjusted totals. The requester must be strictly higher; a tie preserves the refusal.</p><p>If the requester wins against refusal, they privately glimpse what looks like the pocket contents. The responder remains unaware and gains no suspicion from this exchange. If the responder wins, their pockets stay private and they become suspicious of the asker. The requester learns no contents and gets no imagined item thought. Only pocket items are checked, not objects held openly in hands. Shared rendering snapshots do not include pocket contents; an authorized successful check reveals them privately to the requester. A resolved check is limited to once per requester and recipient each night.</p><p>Private thoughts use the character's soul voice. The conversation ends after the check so both guests can continue investigating. If speech is unavailable, the displayed line is given reading time before resolution; an interrupted exchange reveals nothing. A speech failure or timeout safely closes the exchange; you can ask again.</p>"},
  {id:'conversation',label:'Talk & voices',title:'Conversation and Character Voices',html:"<p>Conversation partners stop walking and turn toward one another. <b>Chat</b> choices are available even when you have no useful evidence to share. Questions about a specific action keep that action as their topic, rather than being replaced by an unrelated sighting or alibi.</p><p>Open <b>Settings → Character voices</b> to enable sound, choose Automatic, Generated voice or Device voice, select installed male/female device voices, and test a sample. Automatic falls back to generated audio when a device voice fails. Availability still depends on the browser and speech service. Mouths follow spoken dialogue; private thoughts do not move lips.</p><p>Moving human hair reacts to walking, turning and wind. Short grooms retain their styled support; long locks keep their lengths after collision or cutting. NPCs plan around furniture and open door leaves, recover from obstructed corners, open clear doors as needed, and close them only when the crossing is clear. Barricaded doors remain blocked.</p>"},

A d20 uses your stealth and persuasion against their attention and trust. A human recipient still chooses Accept or Decline.</p><p>With permission, both guests walk to the bathroom barber chair.

  {id:'lighting',label:'Light & darkness',title:'Switches, Lamps and Sight',html:"<p><b>Flashlight travel:</b> holding the Flashlight lets you use halls, doors and basement ladders during the flicker. A mutually accepted team-up extends this to a living, conscious partner within five metres and a clear path. Being near an unrelated light carrier does not count. Dropped, pocketed or gone flashlights grant no protection; torches do not grant this travel permission. When protection ends, your character runs to the nearest reachable refuge, then closes its doors. If already sheltered, they close the doors and stay. Paired ladder travel has a three-second hand-off at the same hatch so a partner can follow between floors. The light carrier must remain beside the other end. Separating beyond that protection triggers retreat.</p><p>Look for a wall switch beside each room entrance. Use the normal interact key to turn ceiling lights on or off. Floor lamps and the portable desk lamp have separate switches; aim at the lamp to toggle it.</p><p>Dark rooms are much harder to see into. Your guest also has less range and confidence when noticing people, evidence and events. A nearby silhouette may still be noticed. Hearing does not improve with light.</p><p>Fires, torches and lamps can provide local pools of light. The murder-phase blackout can override normal fixtures.
